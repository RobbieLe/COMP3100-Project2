# COMP3100-Project2
Stage 2 of the project for COMP3100, where a new scheduling algorithm is to be implemented

# COMP3100-Project-Stage 2 - Project Specifications
Your task in this stage is to design and implement at least one new scheduling algorithm that 
optimises one or more objectives. In particular, your scheduling algorithm as part of your client shall 
schedule jobs to servers aiming to achieve one or more of the following:
- Minimisation of average turnaround time
- Maximisation of average resource utilisation
- Minimisation of total server rental cost

As these objectives are incompatible/conflicting performance objectives, the optimisation of one 
objective might lead to sacrificing the optimisation of other metrics. For instance, if you attempt to 
minimise average turnaround time by minimising waiting time, you may end up using more 
resources resulting in high costs (i.e., server rental costs). Therefore, you have to define the 
scheduling problem clearly indicating your performance objective(s) and justifying your choice. In 
addition, you must discuss your algorithm and scheduling results in comparison with three baseline 
algorithms (FF, BF and WF) and their results
